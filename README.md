## Cache using mongoDB for Go

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/mehmetalisavas/mongo-cache
```

## Description about package
In this package, while creating constructor, self-referential function is used to avoid passing nil value to the function as parameter.
It might be confusing at first, but all required functions are granted for usage.
After creating constructor, you can set necessary field with config options (you can see at examples or take a look tests)

## Usage

```go
session = initMongo() // you need to create a session for mongoDB

// Init MongoCache with defaults
NewMongoCacheWithTTL(session)

// Init MongoCache with TTL option
duration := time.Minute * 3
cacheTTL := NewMongoCacheWithTTL(session, SetTTL(duration))

// Also you can pass multiple config options while initing MongoCache
NewMongoCacheWithTTL(session, SetTTL(duration/2), SetGCInterval(duration), StartGC())

Granted Config options:
- func MustEnsureIndexExpireAt() Option
- func StartGC() Option
- func SetTTL(duration time.Duration) Option
- func SetGCInterval(duration time.Duration) Option
- func SetCollectionName(collName string) Option

```


## Examples
```go
var (
	// session is the default session with default options
	session = initMongo()
)

mgoCache := NewMongoCacheWithTTL(session)
defer mgoCache.StopGC()

key := "cacheType"
value := "mongoDB"

if err := mgoCache.Set(key, value); err != nil {
    return err
}
data, err := mgoCache.Get(key) // data : "mongoDB"
if err != nil {
    return err
}

```
